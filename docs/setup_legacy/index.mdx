# Setup

## Spigot / Paper / Purpur Setup
### Prerequisites
- Geyser-Spigot
- Floodgate (optional)
### Instructions

1. Place the [GeyserExtras.jar](https://modrinth.com/plugin/geyserextras/versions#all-versions) 
under the `plugins/` folder

2. Ensure that `external-address` and `external-port` in the config.yml are set to whatever your external Geyser address is. This is usually the address you give to your players. 

> You will need to load the plugin on the server at least once for the config to generate, and to reload the configuration you will need to restart the server (/reload command will be added eventually)

3. Done! The plugin should now work.

## Proxy Setup
### Instructions

1. Place the [GeyserExtras.jar](https://modrinth.com/plugin/geyserextras/versions#all-versions) 
under the `plugins/` folder in both your proxy and your backend.

2. Boot up your backend, and ensure that `proxy-mode` in the config.yml is set to `true` on your backend server.
