# Setup

## Spigot / Paper / Purpur Setup
### Prerequisites
- Geyser-Spigot
- Floodgate (optional)
### Instructions

1. Place the [GeyserExtras.jar](https://modrinth.com/plugin/geyserextras/version/1.21.0-v1.1.4) 
under the `plugins/` folder

2. Ensure that `external-address` and `external-port` in the config.yml are set to whatever your external Geyser address is. This is usually the address you give to your players. 

> You will need to load the plugin on the server at least once for the config to generate, and to reload the configuration you will need to restart the server (/reload command will be added eventually)

3. Done! The plugin should now work.

## Proxy Setup
### Instructions

1. Place the [GeyserExtras.jar](https://modrinth.com/plugin/geyserextras/version/1.21.0-v1.1.4) 
under the `plugins/` folder in both your proxy and your backend.

2. Boot up your backend, and ensure that `proxy-mode` in the config.yml is set to `true` on your backend server.
> You will need to load the plugin on the server at least once for the config to generate, and to reload the configuration you will need to restart the server (/reload command will be added eventually)

3. Ensure that `external-address` and `external-port` in the config.yml are set to whatever your proxy's external Geyser address is. This is usually the address you give to your players. 

4. [Set up floodgate for proxy,](https://github.com/GeyserMC/GeyserWiki/blob/master/_includes/setup/instructions/floodgate/proxy.md) ensuring that `send-floodgate-data` is `true` in floodgates config.

4. Copy `GeyserOptionalPack.mcpack` and `GeyserExtrasPack.mcpack` from the GeyserExtras folder on your backend to your proxy's Geyser instance.

5. Restart both your proxy and your backend.

6. Done! The plugin should now work.

# Config

> If Geyser-Spigot is detected, all required config changes will be automatically applied.
# Java Parity

## `enable-custom-cooldown`
### **Requires `show-cooldown: "false"` in Geyser's config.**
#### Values: `true` | `false`
#### Default: `true`
Enable the custom cooldown.

## `enable-java-only-block-placement`
### Requires `disable-bedrock-scaffolding: true` in Geyser's config for forward block placements.
#### Values: `true` | `false`
#### Default: `false`
Forces block placements to not be hold-bridgable/scaffold-bridgeable.


# Fixes

## `enable-block-ghosting-fix`
#### Values: `true` | `false`
#### Default: `false`
Updates the block at the player's line of sight every tick to remove ghost blocks.

## `enable-knockback-attack-sprint-fix`
#### Values: `true` | `false`
#### Default: `true`
Enables the Knockback Attack Sprint fix.

In Java, when you execute a Knockback attack, the player stops sprinting for one tick.
The workaround for Bedrock tricks the client into having no hunger for a tick, however this temporarily makes the hunger bar look empty.

# Features

## `auto-reconnect`
#### Values: `true` | `false`
#### Default: `true`
When the server closes or Geyser reloads, reconnect all Bedrock Players to the server using `external-address` and `external-port`.

## `external-address`
#### Values: Any valid IP or Domain Address
#### Default: `"mc.exampleaddress.net"`
This is the external Bedrock address players connect to via WAN, NOT LAN/localhost.
**You should set this to the address you give to your players.**

## `external-port`
#### Values: Any whole number from 0-65535
#### Default: `19132`
This is the external Bedrock port players connect to via WAN, NOT LAN/localhost.
**You should set this to the port you give to your players.**

## `enable-skin-saving`
#### Values: `true` | `false`
#### Default: `false`
Enables downloading of Bedrock Player skins.
> Please note that this is only the skin that Floodgate converts to the Java model format, meaning that some marketplace skins like 128x128 skins, character creator skins or even some classic skins with weird geometry may not look 100% identical or may look lower resolution.
