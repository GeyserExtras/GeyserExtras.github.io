# Installing GeyserExtras
:::info
You can find downloads for GeyserExtras at the footer of the page.

    <TabItem value="Standalone">
    :::info
    This is the recommended way to install GeyserExtras, and has the most feature compatibility.
    :::
    :::note
    You do not need to also have Geyser installed on your backend server.
    :::
    # Instructions

    1. Start by setting up [Geyser-Standalone](https://geysermc.org/wiki/geyser/setup#general-setup--configuration).

    2. Once you have done that, locate the `extensions/` folder in your Geyser instance folder, and place the `GeyserExtras.jar` in it.

    3. Now, run Geyser-Standalone, and the extension should run!

    
    # Floodgate Setup (optional)
    :::info
    This is recommended if you are using a modded server, and would like to use Floodgate with Geyser-Extras.
    :::
    1. [Install Floodgate](https://geysermc.org/wiki/floodgate/setup) on your backend server, and copy the `key.pem` file from the root of Floodgate's plugin folder to the root of your Geyser-Standalone instance's folder.
    2. Change `auth-type` to `floodgate` in Geyser-Standalone's `config.yml`.
    3. Restart your server, and you should now login with your Bedrock Edition account!
