The GeyserExtrasPack works around the biome fog from being only the color red when in The Nether when the GeyserMC config option `above-bedrock-nether-building` is `true`.

This is accomplished by redefining the biome fog in the GeyserExtrasPack which removes the dimension restriction on the fog as the `above-bedrock-nether-building` translates The Nether as The End.
