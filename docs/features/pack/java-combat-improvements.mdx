## Attack Indicator
The texture used in the Java Edition of Minecraft has been ported to Bedrock Edition in GeyserExtras.

## Combat Sounds
The sounds used for combat in the Java Edition of Minecraft have also been ported.

## Combat Particles
The particles used in the Java Edition of Minecraft are from the [GeyserOptionalPack by GeyserMC](https://geysermc.org/wiki/other/geyseroptionalpack) of which GeyserExtras automatically downloads and applies when Bedrock Edition players join your server.

## Showcase
Below is a video with both the Attack Indicator and the Combat Sounds enabled.
